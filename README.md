## Overview

HPO Mapper is a HIPAA-compliant tool for automatically extracting Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from unstructured clinical documentation. The system integrates large language models with a vectorized HPO ontology database to standardize phenotypic descriptions for genetic analysis.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Utilizes AWS Bedrock's large language models to identify clinical phenotype descriptions in medical notes
- **Vector Similarity Matching**: Employs semantic vector matching to map clinical descriptions to standardized HPO terminology
- **Hybrid Matching Approach**: Combines vector-based similarity calculations with fuzzy string matching for robust term identification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for each mapped HPO term to assist with validation
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Operates within a secure AWS environment to ensure patient data privacy
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Jupyter notebook interface for data filtering and processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hpo-mapper.git
   cd hpo-mapper
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```
   aws configure sso
   ```

### Usage

HPO Mapper can be used through the provided Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Data Loading and Filtering**:
   - Load clinical notes from CSV files
   - Filter notes by MRN, encounter type, and event description
   - Prepare filtered notes for HPO term extraction

2. **HPO Term Extraction**:
   - Configure AWS Bedrock connection
   - Run HPO Mapper on filtered clinical notes
   - Review extracted HPO terms with confidence scores

3. **Results Analysis**:
   - Visualize extracted HPO terms
   - Explore correlations between clinical phrases and HPO terms
   - Export results in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)

## Example Workflow

```python
# Initialize HPO database with embeddings
hpo_db = HPOVectorDB(embedding_file="G2GHPO_metadata.npy")

# Initialize LLM client
llm_client = BedrockLLM(model_id="anthropic.claude-v2")

# Initialize HPO Mapper
phenoscope = PhenoScope(
    llm_client=llm_client,
    hpo_db=hpo_db,
    fuzzy_match_threshold=80
)

# Process clinical notes
results = phenoscope.process_clinical_notes(
    notes_file="patient_notes.csv",
    output_file="hpo_results.csv"
)

# Display results
print(f"Extracted {len(results)} HPO terms")
display(results.head())
```

## Project Structure

- `phenoscope_main.py` - Core HPO Mapper implementation
- `hpo_vectorization.py` - HPO ontology vectorization utilities
- `aws_helper.py` - Helper functions for AWS authentication
- `PhenoScope Extracting HPO Terms from Clinical Notes.ipynb` - Main workflow notebook
- `requirements.txt` - Required Python packages

## Performance

HPO Mapper transforms genetic testing workflows by addressing the fundamental challenge of standardizing phenotypic descriptions. By automating HPO term extraction from clinical notes, the system reduces documentation time by 70-80%, allowing genetic counselors to focus on clinical interpretation.

The standardized terminology significantly enhances the precision of genetic test selection and variant interpretation, particularly crucial in pediatric settings where accurate phenotyping directly impacts diagnostic yield.

## Security and Compliance

HPO Mapper is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind:

- All processing occurs within secure AWS environments
- No patient data is stored permanently outside of your secure infrastructure
- User authentication and authorization through AWS IAM
- All API calls are encrypted in transit
